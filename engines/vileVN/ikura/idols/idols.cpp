/*TODO: 
	Handle some new text situations in the IkuraDecoder class iop_pm:
	
	"2B 17 00 03 01 00 FF 92 BE 01 01 5A 00 13 04 01 00 01 00 FF FF FF 00" 
	ends up spitting out 0x64 "Z" character and gives an error for an invalid 
	sound resource 0x03. I'm not really sure what this is intended to do yet.
	It could have something to do with Kyoka's name displaying in pink? The "Z"
	character always shows up right before she speaks. It seems to also appear 
	before Megumi (name in blue) or Aya (name in pink) speak, so that guess
	seems pretty likely. Voices aren't working either, and this is probably 
	related.
	
	Perhaps look at opcode 0x6F usage. It doesn't seem important, but who knows?
	
	Character names are not being printed. Since they aren't using images,
	they don't "just work" like they have in other games.
	
	The game plays pretty well. I'll save fixing the text problems mentioned 
	above for someone else, as my attempts at tweaking the iop_pm function and 
	understanding intended behavior have proven frustrating.
